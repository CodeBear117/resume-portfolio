          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 text-sm text-gray-700">
            <li>
              I designed production-grade robot programs for high-volume
              automated manufacturing. My programs prioritised cycle time
              minimisation, modularity in order to adjust production volume
              rapidly, and safety.
            </li>
            <li>
              I designed and commissioned 3 complex robotic manufacturing
              processes for 3 key stages in the manufacture of hydrogen fuel
              cells. Namely, an automated sand-blasting process for
              surface-prep, an automated HVOF thermal spraying process, and an
              automated plasma coating process.
            </li>
            <li>
              I designed numerous robot end-of-arm tools (EOAT) that were used
              in extreme environments meaning they had to be internally cooled
              and wired. I developed complex CAD (Inventor and Solidworks) parts
              and assemblies, making use of OEM components such as pneumatics,
              and sensors.
            </li>
            <li>
              I coordinated testing and evaluation of new processes and designs
              which included the use of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and
              Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to analyse loads and gas
              dynamics within robotic cells. I often presented findings and
              recommended improvements to management.
            </li>
            <li>
              I fabricated parts in-house using standard machine shop equipment
              such as mills, lathes, bandsaws and GD&T tooling. I have hands on
              experience with materials such as Aluminium, Titanium and Steel,
              which I used selectively which developing robotic EOATs and
              peripherals.
            </li>
            <li>
              I developed comprehensive setup, usage, and maintenance
              documentation for robotic cells, facilitating easy reference for
              factory staff.
